# ----------Docker (Beginners)----------

# list all the docker containers
docker ps

# list all the docker images
docker images 

# pull a docker image from docker hub
docker pull <image name>:<tag>
For example docker pull mysql:latest

# build docker image from docker file
docker build <path to docker file>  -t java-app
-t --> tag, here java-app is a name and tag for docker image

docker file --> docker image --> docker container
image coming from docker hub is pulled
image coming from docker file is build

# To create a container using mysql:latest image
docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test@123 mysql:latest
-e --> environment variable flag
-d --> detach, will run in background

# To execute a container, go inside the container
docker exec -it <container id> sh
-it --> interactive terminal

# Run mysql inside the container
mysql -u root -p

# Check the status of a service
systemctl status docker

# Java installation
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk

# To create an flask-app image from Dockerfile
docker build . -t flask-app

# To create a flask-app container from it's image
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-app:latest

# Forcefully stop a running container
docker kill <container id>

# Remove stopped containers
docker rm <container id>

# Creating an nginx container
docker run nginx
If the nginx image is not available locally, then docker checks
Docker hub for it's image and downloads it

# Command to remove all containers in Docker
docker container prune

docker system prune

# Remove all docker images
docker image prune --all --force

# Main purpose of docker
To provide an efficient way to package and deploy applications.


# ----------- Docker (Advanced) -----------

# Volumnes in docker
Volume is a mechanism for persistently storing and managing data that needs to be shared or accessed by Docker containers. Volumes provide a way to separate data storage from the lifecycle of containers, allowing data to persist even when containers are stopped, started, or removed. Volumes are an important feature in Docker because they enable data to be preserved and shared across containers and container instances.
