# ----------Docker (Beginners)----------

# list all the docker containers
docker ps

# list all the docker images
docker images 

# pull a docker image from docker hub
docker pull <image name>:<tag>
For example docker pull mysql:latest

# build docker image from docker file
docker build <path to docker file>  -t java-app
-t --> tag, here java-app is a name and tag for docker image

docker file --> docker image --> docker container
image coming from docker hub is pulled
image coming from docker file is build

# To create a container using mysql:latest image
docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test@123 mysql:latest
-e --> environment variable flag
-d --> detach, will run in background

# To execute a container, go inside the container
docker exec -it <container id> sh
docker exec -t <container id> bash
-it --> interactive terminal

# Run mysql inside the container
mysql -u root -p

# Check the status of a service
systemctl status docker

# Java installation
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk

# To create an flask-app image from Dockerfile
docker build . -t flask-app

# To create a flask-app container from it's image
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-app:latest
-p --> publish the port, exposing the container port and mapping it with host port 

# Forcefully stop a running container
docker kill <container id>

# Remove stopped containers
docker rm <container id>

# Creating an nginx container
docker run nginx
If the nginx image is not available locally, then docker checks
Docker hub for it's image and downloads it

# Command to remove all containers in Docker
docker container prune

docker system prune

# Remove all docker images or remove single docker image
docker image prune --all --force
docker rmi <image name>
docker rmi -f <image name>

-f --> forcefully remove 

# Main purpose of docker
To provide an efficient way to package and deploy applications.


# ----------- Docker (Advanced) -----------

# Volumnes in docker
Volume is a mechanism for persistently storing and managing data that needs to be shared or accessed by Docker containers. Volumes provide a way to separate data storage from the lifecycle of containers, allowing data to persist even when containers are stopped, started, or removed. Volumes are an important feature in Docker because they enable data to be preserved and shared across containers and container instances.

# List all docker volume
docker volume ls

# Create a new volume
docker volume create --name django-app-volume --opt type=none --opt device=<path> --opt o=bind

# Mount(attach) the docker volume to the docker container
docker run -d --mount source=<volume name>,target=<container's working directory> -p 8000:8000 django-app:latest

# Inspect a volume
docker volume inspect <volume name>

# Docker Compose
Used to run multiple containers (micro-services)

# Check the logs of a container
docker logs <container id>

# To run docker compose
docker-compose up

# To stop docker compose
docker-compose down

# Docker hub login
docker login

# To change image name
docker image tag multi-flask-app:latest negiprashant33/multi-flask-app:latest

# To push image from local to docker hub
docker push <image name>
The image name should be of the following convention to push it to docker hub
<docker hub user name>/<image name>

# To logout from docker hub
docker logout

# Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define a set of services, their dependencies, and the configuration needed to run them, all within a single YAML file called a "docker-compose.yml" file.Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Whenever we require multiple containers and need them to run simultaneously we use Compose as our tool. With Compose we use a YAML file to configure our application services.

#----------Docker Swarm-----------
Swarm --> Cluster
Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool. Container orchestration refers to the process of managing and automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of multiple containers within a cluster or environment.
